## @experimental
##
## Emits [signal all_hooked] when all the configured game elements are hooked.
##
## Could be used to create puzzles. This is a piece of the grappling hook mechanic.
## [br][br]
## The game elements configured must have a [HookableArea] as a direct child, otherwise
## they don't count for emitting the signal.
## [br][br]
## It should be in group [b]hook_listener[/b] so functions [method hooked]
## and [method released] are called.

## Emitted when all [member elements] are hooked.

## Game elements to consider. They must have a [HookableArea] as direct child.

## Part of group hook_listener.
